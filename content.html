<p>Multiple lists can be joined using the <code>+</code> operator to form a new list::</p>

<h2>Basic List Concatenation</h2>

<py-cell>list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5, 6]
combined = list1 + list2

print(combined)</py-cell>

<h2>Multiple Concatenations</h2>

<p>You can chain multiple concatenations:</p>

<py-cell>a = [1, 2]
b = [3, 4]
c = [5, 6]
result = a + b + c

print(result)</py-cell>

<h2>Concatenation Creates a New List</h2>

<p>Concatenation creates a new list without modifying the originals:</p>

<py-cell>original1 = [1, 2]
original2 = [3, 4]
combined = original1 + original2

print(original1)
print(original2)
print(combined)</py-cell>

<h2>Can Only Concatenate Lists to Lists</h2>

<p>You can only use <code>+</code> with two lists. Trying to concatenate a list with another type causes a <code>TypeError</code> as the operands are incompatible:</p>

<py-cell>my_list = [1, 2]
print(my_list + 3)
print(my_list + [3])</py-cell>
